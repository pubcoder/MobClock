<h1>Clock Wallpaper for Sony Ericsson Phones</h1>
<p>I've got Sony Ericsson C702 phone and obviously use it as a clock
  too. However the date and time is shown in a tiny font and is not
  visible enough. There is no way to customise and fix this, thus
  instead I made a small Java ME application that displays the current
  time in large font in a cosy Android theme.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>It should be possible to run in stand-alone mode on
  any JavaME-capable phone, however it's probably only some recent Sony
  Ericsson phones that have a feature of running JavaME application as
  a wallpaper. I assume the following configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device configuration: <b>CLDC-1.1</b></li>
<li>Device profile: <b>MIDP-2.0</b></li>
<li>Screen resolution: <b>240x320</b> (it is possible to change the
  images inside jar and thus fit the app for other resolutions without
  changing the code, feel free to hack it)</li>
<li>A phone that supports <b>SEMC-StandbyApplication: Y</b> (some Sony
  Ericsson model), look for "Application" option for Wallpaper setting
  (see Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Wallpaper).</li>
</ul>
<p>The application does not require any special access or permissions,
  it is self-contained and uses CPU for drawing the screen only
  upon request (it is completely passive when not showing).</p>
<h2>Download and Install</h2>
<p>You need to download <a href="MobClock.jar">MobClock.jar</a> and
  send it to your phone. I prefer OBEX Push method, but you may try
  uploading it first and then installing. Upon installation the phone
  usually suggests to set this application as wallpaper - this is 
  what I choose. Here is a full set of files you might
  need:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="MobClock.jar">MobClock.jar</a></li>
